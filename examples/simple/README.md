# Redux Satisfy

Example app to show usage of a component to satisfy data needs.

Lots of other stuff in it as it's a cut down version of another repo and no time to isolate further.

* [Profile component uses Satisfy](https://github.com/alexFaunt/react-satisfy/blob/master/examples/simple/src/components/Profile/Profile.jsx#L11)
* [Promise middleware tracks pending promises](https://github.com/alexFaunt/react-satisfy/blob/master/examples/simple/src/middleware/promise.js#L17)
* [Server rendered awaits all promises](https://github.com/alexFaunt/react-satisfy/blob/master/examples/simple/src/server/renderer.jsx#L33)
